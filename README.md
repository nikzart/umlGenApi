# umlGenApi
The PlantUML API Service is a Node.js RESTful API that converts PlantUML code into UML diagrams. It interfaces with the official PlantUML server, stores resulting PNG images locally, and uses SQLite for image metadata management. Images are accessible via URLs and are deleted after 12 hours to manage storage and privacy.
